## BORED BOARD
We will be using a telgram bot in order to control the rgb matrix board.

we will be using hzeller rgb matrix board code to control the matrix board. Thus we will use a telegram bot in order to control remotely the rgb matrix board.

Though this is a starter code, it is very buggy, we will need to add authentication to the project too.

https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix

### Functionalities
#### Max character count & Max character per line count
LED Matrix has a size limit, so we will have to change the max character count according to the size of the LED Matrix

#### Take in images sent from user
Image will be displayed on LED Matrix which will be using codes from hzeller

#### Have restricted functions (only give access to certain telegram IDs)
This is to prevent misuse of the telegram bot for posting other messages
